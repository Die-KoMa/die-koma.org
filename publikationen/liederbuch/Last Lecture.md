*Melodie: Last Christmas* (2012)

> *Refrain:*\
> Last lecture I gave you a proof\
> but the very next day you showed me my fail\
> This time to save me from tears,\
> I'll present you something special.

> (repeat)

> My sweet proof is still wrong.\
> The next approach will surely come along\
> Tell me reader, do you understand it?\
> Well, neither do I, I don't comprehend it.

> The paper I wrapped it up and sent it\
> With a note saying "q.e.d.", I meant it!\
> Now I know what a fool I've been\
> But reading it now, I know I will fail again.

> *Refrain:*\
> Last lecture I gave you a proof\
> but the very next day you showed me my fail\
> This time to save me from tears,\
> I'll present you something special.

> (repeat)

> Oooohhhh\
> Oh oh, reader

> The idea was great, and the error so small\
> And maybe the reader will not find it at all.\
> Let's see if it will stay unrecognized\
> And I will pass the course with it.
