# Installation
Short: Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Long: This may be arbitrary hard, depending on your Operating System and how fucked up your ruby installation is, to re-install ruby and install the proper version see following guides:

## Nix (best support)
```sh
# nix packet manager works in almost any linux distribution, mac and wsl1/2
# https://nixos.org/download.html

# with flake-support enabled (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)

# building:
nix build -L .

# development server:
nix run
```


## Debian / Ubuntu
```sh
# ruby installation stuff:
sudo apt remove ruby   # um ruby einmal zu deinstallieren, eigentlich nicht n√∂tig im idealfall
sudo apt install ruby  # oder sudo apt --upgrade ruby
# read output!
# maybe you'll have to add ruby to some path and reload your bashrc
which gem  # should lie in same folder as following:
which ruby
ruby --version  # should be the one installed above
# Bundle stuff:
cd "die-koma.org"
git pull  # make sure to be on master, pull latest version :)
gem install bundler   # should run successfully then
bundle install  # you have to be in the repository
bundle exec jekyll serve  # should run now on 127.0.0.1
```


## Mac
same as above but use homebrew instead of apt.


## Windows
you're lost anyways, I don't know how to handle that odyssee. WSL2 with Nix should work though.


## Windows with WSL Ubuntu
```sh
# clone "die-koma.org" to a directory without any spaces!
cd die-koma.org
# start wsl in the directory
# install ruby and packages for gem creation
sudo apt install bundler ruby ruby-dev make gcc g++
# configure to install gems locally (don't clutter wsl and system dirs)
bundle config set --local path './ruby-packages/'
# you might have to add the following to _config.yaml:
# exclude: ['ruby-packages']
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --force-polling # should run now on 127.0.0.1:4000
# the Port is available on Windows, just use your normal browser without wsl
```
